StringIO 
 - the StringIO module implements an in-memory file like object. This object can then be used as as input or output to most functions that 
   expect a standard file object
 - use io.StringIo for a binary in memory file-like object -> requires a text

 - io.BytesIO for binary in memory file-like object -> requires bytes.
